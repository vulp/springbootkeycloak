Login test example provided by keycloak:https://www.keycloak.org/
download or start keycloak with docker. If downloaded run example ./kc.sh start-dev
this starts development server

Overriding Spring Boot Auto-configuration is possible but wasn't needed for this time because of lots of boilerplate coding for this simple testing:

TODO test this example with next.js to get more content that is actually more interesting
